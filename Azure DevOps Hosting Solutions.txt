for free
To host a .NET web app for free using Azure DevOps and Azure App Service, you can utilize the free tiers available in both services. Here's a detailed guide on how to achieve this:

Steps to Host a .NET Web App for Free:
1. Sign Up for Azure and Azure DevOps:
Azure Account: Sign up for a free Azure account if you don't already have one. The free account includes 12 months of popular free services and a \$200 credit for the first 30 days.

Azure DevOps: Sign up for a free Azure DevOps account.

2. Create a New Project in Azure DevOps:
Repository: Create a new repository in Azure DevOps and push your .NET web app code to it.

3. Set Up Build Pipeline:
Navigate to Pipelines: In your Azure DevOps project, go to the Pipelines section.

Create a New Pipeline: Click on "New Pipeline" and choose your repository.

YAML Configuration: Use the following example azure-pipelines.yml to set up your build pipeline:

yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '6.x.x'
    installationPath: $(Agent.ToolsDirectory)/dotnet

- script: |
    dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
  displayName: 'Build project'

- script: |
    dotnet publish --configuration $(buildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
  displayName: 'Publish project'

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    ArtifactName: 'drop'
4. Create an Azure App Service:
Free Tier: Use the free tier of Azure App Service to host your web app. The free tier provides 1 GB of storage and limited features but is sufficient for small applications.

Create App Service: In the Azure portal, create a new App Service instance and select the "Free" pricing tier.

5. Set Up Release Pipeline:
Navigate to Releases: In the Pipelines section, go to Releases.

New Release Pipeline: Click on "New Pipeline".

Add an Artifact: Select the build artifact from your build pipeline.

Add a Stage: Add a stage and choose "Azure App Service deployment".

Configure Deployment: Choose your Azure subscription and the newly created App Service instance.

6. Deploy Your Web App:
Run the Pipeline: Save and queue the build pipeline.

Deploy: The release pipeline should automatically trigger after a successful build, deploying your .NET web app to the Azure App Service.

Example Pipeline YAML:
Hereâ€™s a complete example combining build and release:

yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '6.x.x'
    installationPath: $(Agent.ToolsDirectory)/dotnet

- script: |
    dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
  displayName: 'Build project'

- script: |
    dotnet publish --configuration $(buildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
  displayName: 'Publish project'

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    ArtifactName: 'drop'

- stage: 'Deploy'
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployWebApp
    environment: 'production'
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - download: current
            artifact: drop

          - task: AzureWebApp@1
            inputs:
              azureSubscription: '<Your Azure Subscription>'
